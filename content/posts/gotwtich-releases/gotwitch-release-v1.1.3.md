[GoTwitch](https://gotwitch.efw.rocks/) v1.1.3 is out! :tada:

Today I'm releasing a new version of [GoTwitch](https://gotwitch.efw.rocks/), some fixes and quality of life improvements.

Access the app at [https://gotwitch.efw.rocks/](https://gotwitch.efw.rocks/).

## Release v1.1.3

### What's new 

- Minor: A toast message is shown if no stream is found given the selected filters

- Feature: Now you can preview the count of possible outcomes before picking a random streamer

### Fixes

- Fix: Language selector displaying only first 10 languages
- Fix: game filter being empty on refresh

### What's next

Well, not sure about the order of the next features, but I'm planning to add:

- Filter by count of viewers :eyes:
- Filter by count of followers
- Filter by stream duration (at least X hours or at most X hours)
- Tests, tests, tests. :sweat_smile:

I think it'll take a good amount of releases to get there! Let's see how it goes.
